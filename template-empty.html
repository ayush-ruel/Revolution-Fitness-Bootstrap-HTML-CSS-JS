                    <p class="articleInfoPara">Just a few years ago, creatine was something that was talked about like it was a "secret weapon" that was really only for bodybuilders, powerlifters, and other hardcore strength athletes. Today, the secret is definitely out! Athletes of all types take creatine as a way to get more results from their training, and to help them recover between sessions.</p>
                    <p class="articleInfoPara">Make no mistake: Creatine isn't a shortcut to results. If your training and nutrition aren't in order, the benefits it provides will be far less than if they were. But the research is clear that for many athletes, this is one supplement that comes with a significant upside. </p>
                    <p class="articleInfoPara"> "There are plenty of supplements out there where people report great results anecdotally, but the science is either wishy-washy, or simply not there," explains Douglas Kalman, Ph.D., RD, in Bodybuilding.com's Foundations of Fitness Nutrition Course. "With creatine, not only has it built a solid reputation among lifters and many other types of athletes, but the science backing it as a legit performance enhancer is robust and pretty consistent. With over 2,000 studies to date, it's the most effective performance-boosting supplement out there."<i>Intrigued? You're not alone. Here's everything you need to know</i>.</p>
                    <h3 class="subHead" id="subHead01">What Is Creatine Monohydrate?</h3>
                    <div id="imgContainer">

                        </div>
                    <p class="articleInfoPara">"Creatine is a combination of three different amino acids: glycine, arginine, and methionine. That's it—nothing more than a combination of amino acids," writes world-class powerlifter Layne Norton, Ph.D., in the article "Creatine: What It Is and How It Works." </p>
                    <p class="articleInfoPara"> And yet, that simple compound is involved in a vast number of processes in the body. It's a fundamental component in how your body creates its primary form of energy in muscle cells, the compound adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. When muscles contract explosively, or for brief, intense work lasting no longer than 8-12 seconds, creatine (bonded with phosphoric acid as creatine phosphate) is how the muscle creates the energy necessary to do it.  </p>
                    <p class="articleInfoPara"> Most of the creatine in your body is created in the liver and kidneys, but the majority of it is stored in muscle tissue. Creatine is not considered an "essential" nutrient, because healthy human bodies are capable of creating it, and it can also be easily obtained through a diet that contains animal products.  </p>
                    <p class="articleInfoPara"> However, dietary creatine pretty much only comes from animal products. So vegan and vegetarian athletes don't get nearly as much creatine in their diet as those who eat dairy products, eggs, and/or meat. This is one reason why creatine is often recommended as an important supplement for vegetarians.</p>
                    <p class="articleInfoPara"> Creatine monohydrate, the most popular form of creatine supplements, is simply creatine with one molecule of water attached to it—hence the name monohydrate. It is usually around 88-90 percent creatine by weight.You may occasionally see people claim that creatine is a steroid. Norton says this couldn't be further from the truth. </p>
                    <p class="articleInfoPara"> "No, creatine is not a steroid, it is totally different and works in a different manner," he writes. "It is also not a stimulant, although it is sometimes combined with stimulant ingredients like caffeine in pre-workout formulas.</p>
                    <h3 class="subHead" id="subHead2"> What Does Creatine Monohydrate Do?</h3>
                    <div id="imgContainer">
                            <img src="subImg2.jpg" alt="articleImage" id="articleImage">
                        </div>
                    <p class="articleInfoPara">As Layne Norton, Ph.D., explains in the article "Creatine: What It Is and How It Works," "Creatine itself is a fuel source." More specifically, the phosphate-bonded form of creatine is "your body's first choice of energy when performing anaerobic activity, such as lifting weights."</p>
                    <p class="articleInfoPara"> When your body is trying to create the compound that powers quick muscle contractions, ATP, it does so by "borrowing" a phosphate molecule from phosphocreatine and combining it with another compound, ADP. Only after a muscle has largely used up its store of phosphocreatine does it start to produce ATP from other sources, like glucose or fats.</p>
                    <p class="articleInfoPara"> "Supplementation with creatine serves to increase creatine stores and phosphocreatine availability in the body, resulting in faster ATP formation," writes exercise physiologist Ciaran Fairman, Ph.D., in the article "6 Side Effects of Creatine Debunked." "Bottom line: The more phosphocreatine you have, the more work you can accomplish before fatigue sets it."</p>
                    <p class="articleInfoPara"> A secondary function of creatine is to draw water into muscle cells, making them more hydrated."When muscle cells are hydrated a few things happen, the most notable being an increase in protein synthesis," explains Norton.As many lifters will attest, this action of drawing water into the cell can also make their muscles look bigger or fuller</p>
                    <h3 class="subHead" id="subHead3">What Are The Benefits Of Taking Creatine Monohydrate?</h3>
                    <div id="imgContainer">
                            <img src="subImg3.jpg" alt="articleImage" id="articleImage">
                    </div>
                    <p class="articleInfoPara">Creatine's reputation among athletes is largely built around gains in strength and muscle. And according to strength coach and researcher Brad Schoenfeld, Ph.D., CSCS, that reputation is well-earned</p>
                    <p class="articleInfoPara">"If you were to ask me for a single supplement recommendation when muscle growth is the goal, I'd say hands-down, no-brainer: creatine," Schoenfeld explains in the article "Ask the Muscle Doc: How Does Creatine Help Muscle Gains?" "Gains of several pounds of muscle are routinely reported when lifters supplement with creatine, over and above just performing resistance training alone.</p>
                    <p class="articleInfoPara"> There are hundreds of studies showing improvements in strength, power, muscle size, fatigue resistance, and overall body composition when people who regularly strength train take creatine. No, it won't simply make you stronger by magic, but it may be able to help you do a few more reps with a heavier weight. And that, over time, can definitely make you stronger.</p>
                    <p class="articleInfoPara">But if you think the benefits end once you step out of the weight room, think again."Contrary to what most people think, you don't have to be a strength or power athlete to reap the benefits of this remarkable supplement," explains researcher Krissy Kendall, Ph.D.Specifically, Kendall says, creatine has been shown to help endurance athletes store more glycogen to use during training or competition. It has also been shown to reduce inflammation and cell damage following lengthy, intense exercise. In layman's terms, that means less pain after training, and less time before you feel up to training again</p>
                    <p class="articleInfoPara">The athletic benefits of this supplement may be even more pronounced in vegetarians. For example, one study that compared creatine use by vegetarians and nonvegetarians found that the vegetarians experienced greater increases in lean tissue and the ability to perform high-volume leg workouts than a nonvegetarian group. This is likely because the vegetarians had lower amounts of stored muscle creatine prior to the experiment</p>
